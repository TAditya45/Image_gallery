    As per the assignment document, I have assumed that I randomly assigned 10 - 20 images status "bad" and based on that,
    I have created a database using the MongoDB document type. The image directory is also an assumption only for this project.

    In real-time applications, the image status will be processed when the image is stored in the database. For this purpose, 
    I have created an "etc" folder which consists of "database.py" for a real-time application.



    The above database.py is a Python script that connects to a MongoDB server and creates a new database and collection to store information about image files. 
    It uses the os library to traverse through a directory containing image files and extracts the directory name as SKUID and file name as unit id. 
    It then reads the contents of each image file and checks if it has a red or green line to determine the status of the image. Based on this, 
    it sets the status of the image as "good" or "bad". Finally, it inserts a document into the MongoDB collection for each 
    image file containing the SKUID, unit id, status, and path of the image file. The script also prints out the ID of the inserted document for each image file. 
    This code can be useful for automating the process of storing and tracking information about images in a MongoDB database.
